A webhook is a way for one application to automatically send information to another application when something specific happens. For example, getting an instant message when a new email is received. It helps different apps talk to each other in real-time. Under Administration section, the webhook service makes it possible to subscribe to documents after cataloging/classification stages. When a document passes Cataloging or Classification, based on GQL provided in webhook a callback URL is sent to the target system (client system). Similarly, in Forcepoint Data Classification, a webhook can be used to send information to client system based on activity of the users. To set up a webhook, you need to specify a condition that will trigger the webhook and the endpoint to send a notification. Once you have defined the condition, the webhook will continuously monitor the source and wait for the event to occur.

Note: Before changing the tunnels that are used in active VPNs, we recommend that you back up the Management Server. You must add or remove Route-Based VPN Tunnel elements manually. In a policy-based VPN, the gateway topology and the number of active endpoints in each gateway element determine the number of tunnels generated for a VPN. After changing the topology of a policy-based VPN, always check that all new or changed tunnels are valid on the Tunnels tab. Each central gateway forms a tunnel with each central and satellite gateway in the VPN. No other Gateway<->Gateway tunnels are created. Tunnels are not generated between endpoints that cannot connect to each other. For example, tunnels are not generated between two endpoints if they both have a dynamic IP address. Adding a gateway under another gateway instead of directly at the main level in the central gateways list can prevent tunnel generation. This configuration implies that the gateway at the main level forwards connections to the gateways below it in the hierarchy. For the forwarding to work, it must be explicitly configured in the central gateway’s Access rules with the SD-WAN Action setting in the Action options set to Forward.
