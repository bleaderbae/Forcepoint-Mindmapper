The SmartEdge agent executes policies from the agent itself eschewing the need to wait for the device to connect to a network box or cloud proxy before policies are applied. This also ensures protection of user credentials and traffic since neither the users credentials nor their private traffic are inspected at the cloud proxy, instead being handled locally on the device. To learn about how to setup the web proxy policies, refer to Configuring SWG policies. Note: The SmartEdge agent will also be replacing the current Device Profiling Agent/Forward Proxy Agent as it will now encompass the features that agent offered in addition to web proxy policy capabilities. This means that the SmartEdge agent will be able to profile devices to identif",

Note: Before installing the agent, ensure your AV/EDR policies allow the installer and agent runtime to run and create outbound connections. The agent connects to AWS Cloud Services using mutual TLS (mTLS); TLS inspection or certificate substitution must be disabled. The AWS IoT connection uses MQTT over WebSockets (WSS) on TCP 443, so WebSocket traffic must be allowed and not intercepted. Anti-Virus Software Some anti virus software may flag the agent. If installing alongside other 3rd party security tools, then you will need to consider adding the following executables and exclusions to the allow list of your antivirus software to ensure there are no cross conflicts. Note: In all cases ensure that: The specified file or folder is bypassed from all scans. Include any child processes when specifying .exe For Windows Filename Folder Dserui.exe %programfiles%\\Forcepoint\\Forcepoint Agent\\ ProxyUI.exe %programfiles%\\Forcepoint\\Forcepoi",
